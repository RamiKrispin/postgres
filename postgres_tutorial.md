On mac I highly recommand to install PostgreSQL through the [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/):

When opening the app, you should have a default server set to port 5432 (make sure that this port is available):

To launch the server click on the `start` button:

By default, the server will create three databases - `postgres`, `YOUR_USER_NAME`, and `template1`. You can add additional server (or remove) by clicking the `+` or `-` symbols on the left botton.


To run Postgres from the terminal you will have to set define the path of the app on your `zshrc` file (on mac) by adding the following line:

``` zsh
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/14/bin/
```

Where `/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/14/bin/` is the local path on my machine.

Alternativly, you can set the alias from the terminal by running the following"


``` zsh
echo "export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/14/bin/" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc
```
